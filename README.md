# CST438 Educaiton Managment System

Directed Group project for CST438 Software Engineering

Software Requirement Specification Document [SRS Doc](https://github.com/bustyAI/CST438-Assignment2-03/blob/v1.0secure/Software-Requirements-Specification-(SRS).pdf)

Utilizing Agile methodologies(BDD), our team developed a comprehensive school management system catering to students, instructors, and administrators. This application facilitates enrollment, course creation, and grade management functionalities.
Our backend infrastructure is built on Spring Boot Java, REST API. Complementing this, we leveraged React and JavaScript for the frontend. Testing was conducted using MockMvc for backend validation and Selenium for frontend evaluation.
An essential addition to our system was the integration of JSON Web Token (JWT) security measures. This implementation ensures that only authorized users can access specific pages and perform actions corresponding to their JWT tokens.
The primary development branch, V1.0secure, reflects the latest iteration of our system with the JWT security features fully implemented. Other branches represent different stages of our project progression, as directed by our academic instructor.
